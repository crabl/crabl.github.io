      <h1>What I Want In a Tool For Thought</h1>
      <h4>Built-in spaced repetition</h4>
      <p>Somewhere, hiding within the hypertext medium is actually a really great spaced-repetition system in disguise: the key is surfacing links at appropriate times (to prevent the user from falling into a Wikipedia-like rabbit holes every time they go through their knowledge bases). The reason spaced repetition is important to me is because people often say things like "I don't need to go around memorize things, because that gives me more time and space for doing deep thinking". This is a distortion of reality: memorization is a necessary, but not sufficient part of creating associations inside the brain. Without "deep knowledge", there can be no "deep thought". However, external spaced repetition systems like Anki have significant overhead, and on their own do not have the tools to become a full-fledged knowledge management system; conversely I haven't seen any attempts to bring spaced repetition into the realm of note-taking systems.</p>

      <h4>"Convenience" features & using the periphery*</h4>
      <p>Despite the overwhelming vitriol that there is on the internet about the <a href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank">Hey.com</a> e-mail system, one of the things I think they got right was their <a href="https://hey.com/features/set-aside/" target="_blank">use of the periphery</a> for "setting things aside" and as a way of signifying "reply later". The best we've got in note-taking apps like Bear and Apple Notes is the concept of "flags" and "pinned notes" which are not adequate, in my opinion (because they hide the information: sometimes you want a sticky note on your monitor!). Perhaps a "virtual shelf" is a better metaphor for describing it, but I haven't settled on what this looks like yet.</p>

      <h4>Sketching as a first-class citizen*</h4>
      <p>In addition to having an amazing text editor, I am also a big fan of using tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil to bring sketching into the "thought medium" as well. I frequently find myself writing a note in Bear on my iPad and wanting to quickly insert a sketch, for example. To do this, I need to open Notability or another app to do the sketch, and then copy and paste it into my note. This is frustrating and tedious, and worse, I can't easily edit the sketch after I've pasted it because it's a bitmap file without any history data (for performing undo and redo operations after the sketch has been inserted into my note). I see sketching as such an amazing and simple way of communicating ideas to both myself and to others, and I'm sad to see that nobody treats it as a first-class citizen in these apps.</p>
