        <p>
          As luck would have it, I've decided to start to blog again. Now before you go and link to this insightful, world-changing post
          on Reddit, Hacker News and StackOverflow (which you almost certainly won't, anonymous visitor), let me provide a quick disclaimer:
          the current count now stands at three. Three blogs I've started, and with the certitude of a Trump presidency, have stopped posting
          on almost immediately after hitting the submit button on the inaugural "Hello, World" post.
        </p>

        <p>Three. Damn. Blogs.</p>

        <p>Four if you count Tumblr (which you shouldn't). Five if you count that time in high school when I accidentally
          published the contents of my entire hard drive to the deep web (oops).
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
  $(document).load(function () {
    alert("prepare yourself for the most amazing blog evarrrrr");
  });

  // I've included jQuery on this page too,
  // because what kind of monster doesn't need it?
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          This time will be different. I'm motivated. I've been writing drafts of posts for <strong>literally months</strong> at this point.
          My GitHub contribution chart makes it look like I haven't slept in eight weeks (it's been closer to six, actually). I've hand-written a sick
          theme using less than 100 lines of CSS like all the cool kids are doing now. My BEM syntax has never been more on point. Plus, the
          thought of being able to share my thoughts at will with random strangers on the internet just makes me twitch with uncontrollable delight.
        </p>

        <p>(leave while you still can)</p>

        <p>So yeah. Let's do this.</p>
