        <p>
          Way back in undergrad, I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://pygmytrollproductions.com/">Curtis Litchfield</a> on an semester-long independent study project. 
          We developed <a href="https://github.com/crabl/headspace">Headspace</a>, a Python library that makes it easy to do real-time positional audio in 3 dimensions. It's written in Python and uses an amazing DSP library called 
          <a href="http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/">PYO</a> written by <a href="http://olivier.ajaxsoundstudio.com/">Olivier B&eacute;langer</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function">Head-Related Transfer Functions</a> (HRTFs), Headspace provides a simple, fast API for developers to add positional audio to their applications. Here is a sample application:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="lang-python">
  from pyo import *
  from headspace import *

  # Start the audio server
  s = Server().boot()
  s.start()

  # Take a PYO WAV object, put it in 3D space, and start playing it
  shaverWav = SfPlayer("shaver.wav", loop=True)
  shaver = HeadSpace(shaverWav, 0, 0).out()
  shaver.ctrl(title="Shaver")

  # Put another sound somewhere else in the space
  backgroundWav = SfPlayer("VictorOrchestra-BlackWhiteRagtime.wav", loop=True)
  background = HeadSpace(backgroundWav, 100, 30).out()

  doorOpenWav = SfPlayer("dooropen.wav", loop=True)
  doorOpen = HeadSpace(doorOpenWav, -20, -10).out()

  phoneRingWav = SfPlayer("phonering.wav", loop=True)
  phoneRing = HeadSpace(phoneRingWav, -150, -20).out()
  phoneRing.ctrl(title="Phone Ring")

  # Create a simple user interface
  s.gui(locals())
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Recently, I've received some requests from folks who have used this library in their own research, and I've been trying to make it a little more performant and accurate.
          One issue that's been causing me some trouble however, is when the setAzimuth and setElevation methods are called rapid-fire, there is a perceptible "pop" when swapping out the
          impulse responses... My inkling is that moving some of the methods to PYO's <a href="http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/_modules/pyolib/tableprocess.html#TableMorph">TableMorph</a> 
          data structure would eliminate this issue, but doing signal processing is very taxing on my brain, no matter how simple PYO makes it!
        </p>

        <p>
          In the mean time, check out the source on <a href="https://github.com/crabl/headspace">GitHub</a> today, and submit a pull request if you understand DSP better than I do!

          As luck would have it, I've decided to start to blog again. Now before you go and link to this insightful, world-changing post
          on Reddit, Hacker News and StackOverflow (which you almost certainly won't, anonymous visitor), let me provide a quick disclaimer:
          the current count now stands at three. Three blogs I've started, and with the certitude of a Trump presidency, have stopped posting
          on almost immediately after hitting the submit button on the inaugural "Hello, World" post.
        </p>

        <p>Three. Damn. Blogs.</p>

        <p>Four if you count Tumblr (which you shouldn't). Five if you count that time in high school when I accidentally
          published the contents of my entire hard drive to the deep web (oops).
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="lang-javascript">
  $(document).load(function () {
    alert("prepare yourself for the most amazing blog evarrrrr");
  });

  // I've included jQuery on this page too, because
  // what kind of monster doesn't need jQuery?
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          This time will be different. I'm motivated. I've been writing drafts of posts for <strong>literally months</strong> at this point.
          My GitHub contribution chart makes it look like I haven't slept in eight weeks (it's been closer to six, actually). I've hand-written a sick
          theme using less than 100 lines of CSS like all the cool kids are doing now. My BEM syntax has never been more on point. Plus, the
          thought of being able to share my thoughts at will with random strangers on the internet just makes me twitch with uncontrollable delight.
        </p>

        <p>(leave while you still can)</p>

        <p>So yeah. Let's do this.</p>
