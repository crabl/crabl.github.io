        <p>An interesting idea hear from unison is the idea of contents addressable code or content addressable blocks. It would be really interesting to use Rome where names didn't matter.</p>
        <p>How would Rome work if the only way to edit the contents of your room graph was to open a scratch editor like in unison</p>
        <p>Look into the Destiny linter for automatically put in code into files</p>
        <p>A really cool thing to have with Evergreen notes, would be to add subscribers to Evergreen notes so that they can be notified of changes when they occur. Sort of like the concept of an instant Outliner from Dave winer</p>
        <p>Inside of the drawing tool, it would be interesting to change the grid size, rather than changing the zoom level.</p>
        <p>You could create an interface like a layout.IT that would allow you to define the CSS grid at various levels of Fidelity by zooming in and out of the grid rather than zooming in and out of the document.The interaction that one could use to draw would be tapping and sliding my finger sort of like how the universe app allows you to build CSS grid layout for websites.</p>
        <p>a lot of people believe that design systems will free you to b more creative  but you actually end up less creative because it changes the problem from "what should this hutton look like" to "how should i lay out this page"</p>

        <h1 class="title">Things I Want In a Tool For Thought</h1>
        <span class="date">August 30, 2020</span>
        <h4>Layered text</h4>
        <p>A writing surface that works like Photoshop or Logic Pro rather than Word or VS Code. Indeed, this is very much intended to be a "Photoshop for authors". Instead of having a single-file ordering of text, it would be possible to put certain texts onto different "layers" that would appear before or after other layers. The way I tend to write is in outline form, so it would be very useful to be able to have my outline as the "base layer", and then to add more layers depending on where they fall on my ladder of writing abstractions. This would allow me as a writer to "turn off" the outline layer, for example, after I've composed a certain section of text and I want to read it without the outline, or if I have a passage that's already been "fully formed" in the outline that I want to extract from it and either merge it into an existing layer, or duplicate it and refine it further (and maybe later merge it into a different layer). It would be tremendously helpful to be able to group certain layers of text according to either their contents or other attributes, but these can only be defined at the time a user wishes to write a piece of text, and they must therefore be extremely simple and fast to create and manipulate, and highly versatile.</p>
  
        <h4>Built-in spaced repetition</h4>
        <p>Somewhere, hiding within the hypertext medium is actually a really great spaced-repetition system in disguise: the key is surfacing links at appropriate times (to prevent the user from falling into a Wikipedia-like rabbit holes every time they go through their knowledge bases). The reason spaced repetition is important to me is because people often say things like "I don't need to go around memorize things, because that gives me more time and space for doing deep thinking". This is a distortion of reality: memorization is a necessary, but not sufficient part of creating associations inside the brain. Without "deep knowledge", there can be no "deep thought". However, external spaced repetition systems like Anki have significant overhead, and on their own do not have the tools to become a full-fledged knowledge management system; conversely I haven't seen any attempts to bring spaced repetition into the realm of note-taking systems.</p>
  
        <h4>"Convenience" features & using the periphery</h4>
        <p>Despite the overwhelming vitriol that there is on the internet about the <a href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank">Hey.com</a> e-mail system, one of the things I think they got right was their <a href="https://hey.com/features/set-aside/" target="_blank">use of the periphery</a> for "setting things aside" and as a way of signifying "reply later". The best we've got in note-taking apps like Bear and Apple Notes is the concept of "flags" and "pinned notes" which are not adequate, in my opinion (because they hide the information: sometimes you want a sticky note on your monitor!). Perhaps a "virtual shelf" is a better metaphor for describing it, but I haven't settled on what this looks like yet.</p>
  
        <h4>Sketching as a first-class citizen</h4>
        <p>In addition to having an amazing text editor, I am also a big fan of using tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil to bring sketching into the "thought medium" as well. I frequently find myself writing a note in Bear on my iPad and wanting to quickly insert a sketch, for example. To do this, I need to open Notability or another app to do the sketch, and then copy and paste it into my note. This is frustrating and tedious, and worse, I can't easily edit the sketch after I've pasted it because it's a bitmap file without any history data (for performing undo and redo operations after the sketch has been inserted into my note). I see sketching as such an amazing and simple way of communicating ideas to both myself and to others, and I'm sad to see that nobody treats it as a first-class citizen in these apps.</p>
  
        <h4>An area for focused composition</h4>
        <p>Some of the best "tools for thought" so far have been those which embrace the concept of "focused editing", or "zen mode" (tools like WriteRoom, iA Writer, Bear, even VS Code to some degree). Having a place within the app that encourages and nurtures a "flow state" is essential for doing creative work. A great example of the sort of "focused" composition UI I would like was demonstrated by @rsms on Twitter recently: <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1297978162438008832?s=21" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1297978162438008832?s=21</a></p>
